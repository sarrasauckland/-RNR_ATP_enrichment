# Modelling analyses: ATP stress and ΔRNR evolution

This folder contains code and results for the flux balance analysis (FBA)
experiments described in the manuscript, including:

- Biomass ATP-cost perturbations
- ATPM (non-growth–associated maintenance) forced ATP drain perturbations
- Parameter sweeps (5 – 1000 ATP)
- Methods for resetting biomass stoichiometry and maintaining reproducibility
